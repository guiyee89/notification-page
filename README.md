# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page

![Design preview for the Notifications page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello! 👋

The project is a web page that displays a list of notifications. It was built as a solution to a challenge on Frontend Mentor. The design was provided, and the goal was to replicate it as closely as possible using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

One of the main challenges was implementing the logic for marking notifications as read. This required adding and removing classes dynamically based on user interaction. Another challenge was keeping track of the number of unread notifications and updating the counter in real-time.

Overall, the project was a great exercise in front-end development skills, including responsive design, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and CSS styling.
